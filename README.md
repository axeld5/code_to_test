# code_to_test
The goal of the repository is to facilitate the creation of unittests using LLMs.

It is organized as follows:
- tests_from_file: generates tests for each function in a file
- tests_from_query (WIP): reimplementation of agentcoder to generate functions with tests, from a single natural language query
